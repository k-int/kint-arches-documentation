# Creating a package

## CSV
1. If deploying remotely, connect to the remote machine using the command, replacing `remote_name` with your remote name. 

    `ssh remote_name`

2. Create a mapping file using the Arches UI

    2.1. Go to Arches Designer in the UI and navigate to the relevant resource model(s)

    2.2. Click `Manage...` and select `Export Mapping File` 

    2.3. Unzip the file

    2.3. Once the file is extracted, go into the `file_name.mapping` file, and check that replace all `"export":true` options are set to `true`

3. Create a folder called `mapping_files` 

    `mkdir mapping_files` 

4. Copy the unzipped mapping files to the `mapping_files` folder. If copying to the remote machine use the following command:

    `scp -r /path/to/mapping remote_user@ip /path/to/mapping_files`

5. Create a new directory called `business_data`. 

    `mkdir business_data`

6. Get UUID of the resource model by clicking on the model in Arches Designer and copying it from url, e.g. `graph_designer/copy_this_string`

7. To export the business data from the Resource Model, run the following command for each mapping file, replacing the path to the business folder, the path to the mapping file, and resource model's UUID

    `python manage.py packages -o export_business_data -d './path/to/business_data' -f 'csv' -c 'path/to/mapping_file' -g 'resource_model_UUID'

8. Once the business data is exported. Create a new dicrectory called `packages` using 

    `mkdir packages`

9. Then run the following command to create a new package in this folder. 

    `python manage.py packages -o create_package -d '/path/to/packages/package_name'`

10. Once the package is created its time to move the files from the `business_data` folder you've created to the one created in the package:

    10.1. Remove all files in `bussiness_data` containing the word `group` using this command once in the directory

    ```
    find -type f -name '*group*' -delete
    ```

    10.2. Copy  all .csv files from `business_data` to `packages/business_data` using the command 

    ```
    cp /path/to/business_data/data_name/*.csv /path/to/packages/business_data
    ```

    10.3. Copy all .relations files from `business_data` to `packages/business_data/relations` using the command

    ```
    cp /path/to/business_data/data_name/*.relations /path/to/packages/business_data/relations
    ```

    10.4. Copy all .mapping files to `packages/business_data` using the command:

    ```
    cp /path/to/mapping_files/model_name/file.mapping /path/to/packages/package_name/business_data
    ```

    10.5 Rename the `business_data.csv` file in `packages/business_data` to the same name as your corresponding mapping files (`mapping_file.mapping`), to end up with `mapping_file_name.csv`, using the command:

    ```
    mv business_data.csv mapping_file_name.csv 
    ``` 
    
    10.6 If relevant, copy all files from `uploadedfiles` directory to `packages/business_data/files` using the command
    
    ```
    cp /path/to/uploadedfiles /path/to/packages/package_name/business_data/files
    ```

### Once business data is moved, it's time to download reference data

11. Go to Reference Data Manager in Arches UI click  `Tools` and export each thesauri one by one. You may need to right click and save these from the browser if they open in a new tab. 

    11.2. Once downloaded, move the thesauri to the remote machine's `packages/package_name/reference_data/concepts` using the command

    ```
    scp -r /path/to/thesauri remote_user@ip /path/to/packages/package_name/reference_data/concepts
    ```

12. Go to Refernece Data Manger in Arches UI click `Tools` and export all collections

    12.1. Once downloaded move the collections to the remote machines `packages/package_name/reference_data/collections` using the command

    ```
    scp -r /path/to/collections remote_user@ip /path/to/packges/package_name/reference_data/collections
    ```

13. In `packages` create a new folder called `ontologies` using `mkdir ontolgoies` and within that folder create another directory called `cidoc_crm` and finally move `cidoc` files in there donwloaded from [https://arches.readthedocs.io/en/stable/administering/ontologies-in-arches/](https://arches.readthedocs.io/en/stable/administering/ontologies-in-arches/)
to `ontologies/cidoc_crm/`
